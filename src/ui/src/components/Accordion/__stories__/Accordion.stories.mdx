## Accordion
An accordion hides and shows content that might be distracting if it were visible all the time.

export const Template = (args) => <Accordion {...args}/>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Accordion"
    args={{
      title: 'Title',
      children: 'Content',
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
Use an accordion:
* To provide progressive disclosure by showing detailed info and/or actions when needed without overwhelming users by
making the content visible all the time.
* When a modal to show the detail is not practical:
  * Because the modal would be disruptive or would interrupt a workflow.
  * When detailed content might need to be compared across multiple accordions at once.
* To provide an extended view of a card or other summary.
* If the content is short, consider using a <a href={bookMarks.POPOVER}>popover</a> or <a href={bookMarks.TOOLTIP}>tooltip</a>.

Recommendations
* When collapsed, an accordion should have a useful and informative title. This could be either:
  * A label or heading that explains whats inside Example: “Hardware Utilization”
  * A very succinct summary of the info inside. Example: “50% CPU 60% MEM”, but when opened the accordion reveals a full
time series chart for each metric.
  * A collapsed accordion should never be blank.
* Accordions should generally default to being collapsed.

### Accessibility
Requires more research.
