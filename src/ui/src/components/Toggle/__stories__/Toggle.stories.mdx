## Toggle
A toggle provides a way to switch between two binary and mutually exclusive states (such as an on-off state).

export const Template = (args) => <ToggleWrapper {...args} />

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Toggle"
    args={{
      disabled: false,
      onText: 'On',
      offText: 'Off',
      size: 'default'
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
A toggle should be used when a state change is triggered directly in real time. When a state change will not take effect
until saved/submitted, use a <a href={bookMarks.CHECKBOX}>check box</a>.

Toggles must always have a label on the left that is worded in such a way as to present a binary choice. Opposing choices
are not the correct usage. Example:
* Good (binary): Share project with your organization
* Bad (opposing): Sharing settings

Toggles should have a secondary description on the right that describes the current state. Example:
* <em>Sharing enabled</em>
* <em>Sharing disabled</em>

Toggles can be disabled while also either on or off. If disabled, the secondary description should still reflect the
outcome of the toggle. There should be a hover state that explains what the user needs to do to be able to change the
toggles state.

It is necessary to decide whether to have a toggle set to on or off by default when first rendering a page.
As a rule of thumb:
* A toggle should be off by default when:
  * The off state is the default system state
  * The on state is dangerous or introduces potential risks
  * The on state requires additional configuration that is not necessary for the user to successfully complete their current goal
* A toggle should be on by default when:
  * The on state is default system state
  * The on state is necessary for the user to complete their current goal
  * Most users will want the state to be on


### Accessibility
Labels
* The toggle relies on its left and right labels (described above) in order to be accessible. The visual state alone is
not enough to accessibly communicate the status and outcome of the toggle.
