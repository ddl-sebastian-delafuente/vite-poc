## Breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs show a user where they are current located within Domino and allow them to jump up to higher levels of the
IA.

export const Template = (args) => (
  <Breadcrumbs {...args}/>
);

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Breadcrumbs"
    args={{
      routes
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
For consistency, Breadcrumbs should ideally be used on every page, placed above the page title. They are most valuable,
and therefore strongly recommended in any situation where the page hierarchy puts a user at a deeper level of the IA than is represented in the Nav Bar.

### Accessibility
Requires further research.
