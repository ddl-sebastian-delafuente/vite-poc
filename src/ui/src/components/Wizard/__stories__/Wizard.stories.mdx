## Wizard
A wizard allows a settings form to be split up into multiple steps.

export const Template = (args) => (
  <WizardWrapper {...args} />
);

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Wizard"
    args={defaultsProps}>
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
Use a Wizard any time a form would benefit from being broken up into multiple steps. Examples:
* When a form <a href={bookMarks.MODAL}>modal</a> is needed but there is too much content to comfortably fit in a single page.
* When a form or setup flow involves complexity that can be clarified by creating separate steps.
* When a form has some primary fields that require population every time, but many fields that are optional or have sensible
defaults that the user would rarely modify. Note: With sensible defaults, consider having the wizard “remember” settings
like frequently or most recently used hardware tier.

Recommendations:
* Skipping steps
  * When possible, consider including a green colored “Launch now (or save now)” button that skips the remaining steps
  and attempts to execute the wizard with the remaining defaults.
  * The ability to skip steps is especially important when the same wizard modal is used to edit an already-crafted entity
  and it would be annoying to force a user to step through everything just because one setting had to change.
* How to define steps
  * Optimize the first page (step) of the wizard to show the most frequently changed and required fields. Consider pushing
  fields that are optional or have “sticky” defaults that rarely change into later steps of the wizard.
  * Try to cluster related fields under logical groups for the remaining steps of a wizard
* Subtext beneath the wizard steps
  * These should be used to summarize the settings (or default settings) for that section of the wizard.
  * This is especially useful because it prevents too much memory load on the user as they attempt to recall what they
  set as they step through, or confidence to hit “launch now” without having to check the defaults on optional areas.

### Accessibility
Decrease mental load for users by using the subtext below each step’s name to summarize the current settings for that section.
