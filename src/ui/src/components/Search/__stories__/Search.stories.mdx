import { Canvas, Meta, Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import { CodeLocation, getStandardStoryPath } from '../../../utils/storybookUtil';
import Search from '../Search';

<Meta
  title={getStandardStoryPath('Navigation/Search')}
  component={Search}
  argTypes={{
    size: {
      description: 'The size of Search component. Available types are default and small.',
      control: {type: 'radio'},
      options: ['default', 'small'] ,
    }
  }}
/>

## Search
Search enables a user to find an object that relates to an action they want to take or to some other goal.

export const Template = (args) => <Search {...args} />

<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Search"
    args={{
        placeholder : 'Search',
        size: 'default'
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
Search should be provided as often as we are able because it allows users to find things without needing to manually
sift through our product.

Search should be scoped to the current context. For example, if it is related to a list of items, it should search only
inside that specific list.

Search should be applied to as many fields as possible within the objects that are in scope. This allows a user to find
something by knowing any piece of relevant content (not just, for example, the name of the object). At a minimum, the
(human readable) name and the (system oriented) UID of the object should be included in search, so that if a user has a
very specific object in mind, they can find it.

### Accessibility
More research is probably required here.

Results should be displayed in a way that is accessible to screen readers and to users navigating using the keyboard
(tab key).
