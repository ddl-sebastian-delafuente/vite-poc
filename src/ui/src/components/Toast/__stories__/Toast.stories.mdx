## Toast
Toast messages communicate the status of a user-initiated action.

export const Template = (args) => <ToastrWrapper {...args} />

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Toast"
    args={{
      type: 'success',
      text: 'Toast message that is displayed',
      duration: 2
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
Toast messages should always communicate the status of an action.

To allow for reading time, they should remain on the screen until the user dismisses them or the page is reloaded.

Color and message format both depend on message status:
* Success - Green color. Message format: “[Action name (past tense)] successfully”
* Error - Red color. Message format: “Unable to [Action name]. To address this, [suggested remediation].”
* Pending - Yellow color. Message format: “[Action name]” in progress. When it completes, you will be notified.”

### Accessibility
It is problematic to use just color to encode the status, so make sure that the text alone communicates the message without relying on the color.

We need to do research to find out whether having an element appear/disappear is an issue for screen readers, and if so, what to do about it.
