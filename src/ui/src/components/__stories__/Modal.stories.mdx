## Modal
A modal is used to contain content or actions that are related to, but separate from the current page.

A modal creates focus by hiding and disabling all other content. It also maintains context by remaining on the page of
origin.

export const Template = (args) => (
  <ModalWrapper {...args} />
);

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Modal"
    args={{
      cancelText: 'Cancel',
      isDanger: false,
      okButtonTooltipText: '',
      okText:'Primary action',
      noFooter: false,
      titleText: 'Primary Action',
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
Use a modal in the following situations:
* <b>Ephemeral forms:</b> Use a modal to allow entities to be created or settings to be set in situations where it would
be difficult or disruptive to force a user into a drilldown page. Additionally, having a full page for creating a new
entity can be navigationally awkward (as the alternative is to breadcrumb into an orphaned “create new x” page).
* <b>Ephemeral information/details:</b> Use a modal to show details / information about an entity without forcing the
user to lose page context by navigating them into a drilldown sub-page. This can also help in situations where the
layout constrains the use of a drawer / accordion  “show more”. This is particularly useful when traversing down a list
of entities and the use case demands rapid checking of each entity: full drill-downs would be annoying in these
situations.
* <b>On-boarding / education:</b> A modal can house information that is relevant once but doesn’t need to present on
the page all the time. This can be triggered by a detected event (such as stopping a workspace) or an info icon click
target. When automatically triggered, be sure to include the “do not show again” option tied to the user’s browser.
* <b>Confirmations:</b> A modal can confirm user intent around dangerous actions.
See <a href={bookMarks.CONFIRMATION}>confirmation</a>.

Avoid using a modal in the following situations:
* When the information in the modal needs to be compared with information in other modals or on the rest of the page. In
this case, consider using an <a href={bookMarks.ACCORDION}>accordion</a>.
* When there’s an Information Architecture relationship that needs to be clear, and demands true navigational
representation of a “sub-page”. In this case, consider using <a href={bookMarks.TABS}>tabs</a>.
* When there is a need to be able to deep link to the content inside the modal. In this case, consider
using <a href={bookMarks.TABS}>tabs</a>.
* When the content is short enough to be shown in a popover or <a href={bookMarks.TOOLTIP}>tooltip</a>.

Because of the possibility of losing work, a modal should retain settings entered into it even when closed (as long as
the page is not reloaded).
