## Tooltip
A tooltip contains supplemental information. It hides the information by default and shows it only when a user requests
it. If the information is critical to a user’s success, consider using a <a href={bookMarks.CALLOUT}>callout</a>.

This prevents clutter in the UI and ensures information is shown when it is needed. It also creates a barrier in that a
user must know they need more information in order to get it.

export const Template = (args) => <Tooltip {...args}/>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Tooltip"
    args={{
      tooltipContent: 'I’m a tooltip. Hopefully I’m helpful',
      placement: 'topLeft'
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
Tooltips should be used anywhere that supplemental information could help a user make a decision but isn’t important
enough to be visible all the time. Do not use tooltips for warnings or situations where the information is critical for
a user to know.

Tooltips should generally be triggered by a blue “information” icon. The exception to this is when they are triggered by
interacting with an interactive element (like a disabled button).

Placement should default to “TL”. Other placements should only be used if the element is too close to the edge of the
screen for the tooltip to fit.

### Accessibility
Tooltips should be able to be focused on and opened using only the keyboard. They should be in the tab order immediately
after (?) whatever element they are providing more information for.
