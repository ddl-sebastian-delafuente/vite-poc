# Domino Design System
DDS is a resource for designing and building Dominoâ€™s UI.
Here, you will find usage guidelines and documentation for all of our components in an interactive format.

### Why do we have a Design System?
The goals of DDS are to increase feature <b>velocity</b> and <b>quality</b>.

This is accomplished through two strategies:
1. <b>Single source of truth</b> - DDS ensures that everyone who contributes to our UI knows what components are available. This improves quality by making it easier to decide which components to use. It improves velocity by allowing team members to communicate clearly about components across functional areas.
1. <b>Separation of concerns</b> - DDS allows teams to separate feature work from system improvements. This improves velocity by preventing scope creep during feature implementation. It improves quality by ensuring that component improvements propagate out across all features.
