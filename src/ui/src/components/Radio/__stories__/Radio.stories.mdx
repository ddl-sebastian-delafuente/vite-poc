## Radio
A radio allows a user to choose a single item from a list of options. It is ideal for shorter lists because it shows all
options all the time.

If the list is long, consider using a <a href={bookMarks.SINGLE_SELECT}>single-select</a>. If multiple items can be
selected, consider a <a href={bookMarks.CHECKBOX}>checkbox</a> or <a href={bookMarks.MULTI_SELECT}>multi-select</a>.

export const Template = props => <RadioWrapper {...props} />;

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Radio"
    args={{
      disabled: false,
      disabledReason: 'Radio options disabled',
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
Radio buttons shouldn't initiate actions on their own. To initiate an action, use an Action component like
a <a href={bookMarks.SECONDARY_BUTTON}>secondary button</a> instead.

Vertical alignment is easier to read and parse. Use horizontal or rectangular alignments only if they greatly improve
the layout of the window.

Default selection
- Where one option is more likely than others, it is best to default to having one radio in a group selected.
- Be considerate when setting the default selection. Avoid dark patterns. 
  Eg: When one selection has a clear benefit to us and may or may not be what the user is likely to want, we should avoid biasing the default selection to our benefit. 
  Defaults should aim to make user's actions faster, efficient or easier.

Support bulk select and clear for common patterns such as long tables or lists. Take these capabilities on a case by
case basis, and evaluate whether supporting bulk selections is strictly required in your case. Eg: Small lists with 5
items or less would not benefit much and add overhead.

### Accessibility
Click target
- Users should be able to click/tap the radio or its label to activate it.

Keyboard navigation
- Users should be able to use their keyboard to navigate to and select/deselect options.
