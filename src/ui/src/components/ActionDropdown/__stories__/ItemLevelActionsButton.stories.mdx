## Item-Level Actions Button
An item-level actions acts component combines multiple actions into a single element and provides them as a list of
actions inside of a menu.

This is similar to the <a href={bookMarks.MULTI_ACTION_BUTTON}>multi-action button</a> but is scoped to the
context of an object type that is listed multiple times on the same page. For example, where a page or tab might have a
multi-action button, a table row or a card would use an item-level actions button.

export const Template = (args) => <ItemLevelActionsButtonWrapper {...args} />

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Item-Level Actions Button"
    args={defaultActions}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
Use an item level-actions button when there multiple actions that relate to the same object, especially if similar
objects could appear repeatedly.

Combine actions wherever possible. Doing this provides a few benefits:
1. Reduce visual noise on the page by progressively disclosing the available actions.
1. Make actions easier to find by co-locating them.
1. Allow for more descriptive action names because the text doesn't take up space in the UI.

Item-level actions buttons cannot be disabled. However, any action inside the list of actions could be disabled. A
disabled action should have a tooltip explaining what the user needs to do to make the action available.

### Accessibility
Placement
* Ensure consistent button locations across similar screen layout contexts (eg above a table, on a popup, etc.). This is
like how stop lights always have the same layout for red/yellow/green.
* Item level actions should appear within the object they relate to. Inside this object, they should be high up the
accessibility tree for screenreader users.

Labels
* The item-level actions button will usually not have a label. It should have alternate text that says “Actions for \{object name\}”
In the list of actions, the action text wording should be explicit, descriptive and human readable. Example:
  * Good: “Create document”
  * Bad: “Create”
* Include more descriptive “alternate text” for screenreader users. Example:
  * Action label: “Create document”
  * Action alternate text: “Create a new document in this project”
