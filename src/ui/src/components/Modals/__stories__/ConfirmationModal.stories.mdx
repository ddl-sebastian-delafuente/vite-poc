## Confirmation
A confirmation message acts as a speed bump when a user initiates a destructive or dangerous action.

export const Template = (args) => <ConfirmationModalWrapper {...args} />

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Confirmation"
    args={{
      cancelText: 'Cancel',
      description: 'Are you sure you want to break stuff? This could be dangerous.',
      header: 'Break stuff?',
      okText: 'Break stuff',
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
This pattern loses its effectiveness if overused. It should therefore only be used in situations where an action is
destructive or can have real adverse consequences. If the action is easy to undo without lasting consequences, a
confirmation is likely unnecessary.

(We do not currently have a pattern for extremely destructive/dangerous actions. If you come across a situation where a
simple button click doesn’t feel safe enough, consider defining a new pattern for this type of situation. For example,
you could require the user to type the name of the affected object before the action is taken.)

Configuration:
* It is very important for the button text to be clear. In general:
  *  “okText” should name the action that will be taken if the user proceeds (e.g. “Delete workspace”) This button
  should be a primary danger button.
  *  “cancelText?” should say “Cancel” unless that is unclear for some reason. This button should be a secondary button.
  *  It is better to be descriptive but clear than concise and confusing. (anti-example: “Are you sure you want to
  cancel your subscription? All of your data will be lost. → Cancel / Don’t Cancel”)
* “description” Should explain the consequences of the action and end with “Are you sure you want to {action}?”
* “header” should name the action, followed by a question mark.
* The action name should match as closely as possible between the okText, description and header.
