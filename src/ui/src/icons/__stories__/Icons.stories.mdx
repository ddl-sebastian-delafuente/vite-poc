## Icons
An icon is a singular, visual representation of a state, action, or entity. Our icon library consists of both Domino specific icons and Antâ€™s icon library.

export const Template = (args) => <AllIcons {...args} />

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Icons"
    args={{
      type: IconType.Outlined,
      size: '32px',
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Usage Guidelines
Icons can be used in combination with an action, within a button or link, or stand-alone.
When they are actionable, typically it is represented with a primary blue color. If an icon
is used to represent status, the appropriate status color will be applied. A neutral icon
color may be used if it is not actionable and is used to represent information. This will
reduce visual noise and competition with actionable icons.

### Accessibility
The color of the icon shall have a high enough contrast from the background that it passes level
AA [https://accessible-colors.com/](https://accessible-colors.com/). Avoid icons that are below
16x16px as it may be too small to view clearly.

### Technical Notes
<CodeLocation.Icons/>

### Composition
Icons have a live area (the raw icon) and a trim area (padding between the outer bounds and the live area).
The size of the icon is calculated as the square that contains both the trim area and the live area.
For example, an icon set at 24x24px includes the padding around the raw icon.

<div style={{border: '1px blue solid', width: '26px', height: '26px'}}>
  <LineChartOutlined style={{fontSize: '24px'}}/>
</div>
